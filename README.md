# The Crypto Scrapping Website

This exercise has been made by myself and the support of my team (THP-Nice) in order to pratice scrapping in Ruby on Rails. 
This exercise has been made with Postgresql, open-uri, nokogiri and has been published on Heroku.

Please, after cloning the repo, make a bundle install inside the folder, make a rails db:create, a rails db:migrate then launch the console ( rails c ) and type StartScrap.new.perform to launch the scrapping. 

This scrapping has been build with www.coinmarketcap.com, a famous website which follows the values of all cryptocurrencies.
